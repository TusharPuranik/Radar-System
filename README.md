# Radar-System

The radar system project that I have worked on is a versatile and highly-functional system designed to detect the presence of objects in a certain range and display their location on a user interface. The project is built using an Arduino microcontroller and utilizes several different types of sensors, including infrared and ultrasonic sensors, as well as various LEDs for display purposes.

The project works by emitting signals from the sensors, which bounce off of objects in the environment and return to the sensor. By measuring the time it takes for the signal to return, the system is able to calculate the distance of the object from the sensor. The system uses both infrared and ultrasonic sensors to detect objects at different ranges, providing a wide range of coverage.

The data collected from the sensors is then processed by the Arduino microcontroller, which uses an appropriate algorithm to calculate the distance of the object and its location. The user interface is displayed on an OLED monitor, providing clear and high-contrast information about the detected objects.

In addition to the sensors and OLED monitor, the project also utilizes several LEDs for display purposes. These LEDs are used to indicate the presence of an object at a particular location, and can be customized based on user preferences.

The system is designed to be highly-functional and versatile, and can be used in a variety of settings, including security systems and industrial automation. With its ability to detect and locate objects in real-time, the project has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us.

Overall, this radar system project represents an exciting application of sensor technology and microcontroller programming, and has the potential to provide a wide range of benefits and applications. The addition of the OLED monitor and customizable LED display further enhances the functionality and usability of the system, making it an ideal choice for a variety of different settings and applications.
